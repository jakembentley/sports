    "The NFL is a chaotic mess. There are colloqial truths about player performance: NFL careers are typically short, especially for running backs. If youre a fantasy football manager, you've probably encountered this before. The old addage is don't trust a running back whos at or over 30. Yet you find some outliers from time-to-time. Some prolific performers who were able to have long standing careers. Frank Gore and Adrian Petereson come to mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you look at the performance this year you'll see many players whose performance has dwindled. Most prominently, Eziekel Elliot has looked markedly worse than Tony Pollard. A rash of quarterbacks have also fallen prey to father time. The colts are still cursed to start a veteran quarterback whose right arm could easily have been cast as the lead in Memento. Russell Wilson, once heralded as elite. has a severe case of altitude sickness. Carson Bench is, well, Carson Bench. \n",
